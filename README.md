# utilkit
Some nice scripts for fun programming.  

- Algorithms: implementation for some different problems
- Floodpred: program predicts flooding based on the measuring data
- Media-dl: support scripts 
	- img-dl (download images), 
	- vid-dl (as wrapper script, based on origin program youtube-dl), 
	- doc-dl (download pdf-document)
- Datamanagement: my previous 'Diplomarbeit' and implementation in iRODS-rules and Bash Shell scripts for data management (create, repl, delete, move, etc.)
