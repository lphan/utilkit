These are some nice scripts for fun programming.  

- floodpred: program predict flooding based on the measuring data
- media-dl: support scripts 
	> img-dl (download images), 
	> vid-dl (as wrapper script, based on origin program youtube-dl), 
	> doc-dl (download pdf-document)
- datamanagement: my previous 'Diplomarbeit' and implementation in iRODS-rules and Bash Shell scripts for data management (create, repl, delete, move, etc.)
