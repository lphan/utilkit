			/ Storage1 / Archiv1 (500 files)  : not important Data (*)
			/ Storage1 / Archiv2 (1000 files) : not important Data (*)
			/ Storage2 (500 files) : less important Data (**)			
			/ Storage3 (100 files) : most important Data (***) get replication at GridResc2/Grid3 (1-20 files) and FTPResc2/FTP2 (21-40 files)

"Test 1 :" Correctness ( memory capacity neccessary implizit 15.000.000 oder 20.000.000 )
Target : get enough free memory capacity but this methode were not efficiency

	Step 1 : compress one big file (bigfile.big) (Storage1)
	Step 2 : compress all files (completely Storage2) (500 files)
	Step 3 : delete replication (Storage3) (40files) -> after that, storage3 still has 60 files.
	Step 4 : move files (mostly Storage1) but cause overload at quota (FTPResc2, GridResc2 )

"Test 2 :" Efficiency  ( memory capacity neccessary explizit 15.000.000 oder 20.000.000 )
Target : get enough free memory capacity and this methode were efficiency

	Step 1 : define explicitely memory capacity of user (compress FTPResc2 with defined memory capacity )
		-> with iRODS and Shell
	Step 2 : support method with sort-function	(continue test with FTPResc2)
		-> with iRODS and Shell
	Step 3 : support move data with quota without overload
		3.2 solve overload problem at quota (FTPResc2, GridResc2)
