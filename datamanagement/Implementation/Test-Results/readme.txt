This Directory contains results of Evaluation from Testing.

Hints for Testing :
1. Change the path in files (createRepl), (createBigFile) to create files for testing.

2. Change the path in file (createDataTest) to initial data for Multi-Ressource ( StorageResc2, FTPResc2, GridResc2)

3. Change the path in file (executeTest) to run the test (compress one file, compress more file, delete replication, move file to multi-resource)

4. Change the path in file (irodsunlink) to recover data to initial state (step 2)

Others :
- read Tests-Step.txt to see how Data in Multi-Resources are organized.
- Test-Results are files beginning with test-... (ex. test-compressAllFile.txt)
- Test-RunningTime are files beginning with time-... (ex. time-compressAllFile.txt)
